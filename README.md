# Column_transformer
ColumnTransformer is a tool from scikit-learn that allows you to apply different preprocessing steps to specific columns in a dataset. It's especially useful when handling mixed data types (e.g., numeric and categorical) in a single pipeline, streamlining feature transformation before model training.
